# Dataset-Mutation-and-Hyperparameter-Tuning-Using-Genetic-Algorithm
This repository includes a notebook that employs a genetic algorithm to identify the optimal subset of features from a dataset. Additionally, it fine-tunes the hyperparameters of the decision tree classifier used on the dataset.

## For Yahya
Here is what you have to do: 

- Write documentation and update readme accordingly.
- Clean the code for both notebooks.
- 1 experiment on the genetic algorithm is performed. (Hyperparameter tuning of the decision tree classifier).
- Perform 2 other experiments by editing crossover type etc.
